Time Tien is a simple task management application to better manage your time to make your life easier. Time Tien is designed to track both professional as well as personal tasks all in one place.

This is my first foray as a developer into Rails world. I wrote this application as a way to manage my time at work and also to learn Rails.

Time Tien will always strive to be an effective time management application. You are welcome to add features, refactor or fix bugs.
